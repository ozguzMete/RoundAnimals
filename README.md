Unity Assets of the Round Animals. I was using Unity 2018.2.20f1 64-bit.

Teach animals to your toddlers and your preschoolers in a fun and engaging way!

Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational application to help you teach your toddlers about animals? Look no further than Round Animals.

Round Animals is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it is designed with parent participation in mind. Best of all, Round Animals designed almost add-free. You need to unlock animals only once before unlimited usage until the application's lifespan.

Features:
Colorful early education app that helps toddlers, kindergarteners or preschool age children learn animals.
Includes animations and sounds.
Very easy to use universal interface.
No tricks. Just pure educational fun!
Note to Parents:
When creating Round Animals, I wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for your loved ones. I know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and excessive intrusive third party advertisements can destroy user experience. With Round Animals, I removed paywalls, in-app purchases and third-party advertisements restricted by the number of animals. The end result is exactly the educational experience I want for my children. I think you and your family will enjoy it, too!
